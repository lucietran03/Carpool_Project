This project is for a course at RMIT University before being developed into a more professional project. Also, this project is about carpooling which has a lot of potential for improvement.

First, the main program will load all the data from the files. Furthermore, it will allow the user to select the type of user before allowing them to log in for some specific selection cases. Then, for each type of user they select, there are some features that can be implemented. Finally, the program will load all the data back into the files.
